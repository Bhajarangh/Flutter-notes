Stack in flutter is like a sandwich (in which we one ingredient on top of another), we can keep on top of another

- It’s super useful when you want things to overlap in your app’s design.

### **When to Use Stack ?**

- **Buttons Over Pictures**: Like a play button on a video thumbnail.
- **Text on Images**: Like captions on photos.
- **Cool Designs**: For when you want to mix things up from the usual top-down look

**Note**: The first one is at the bottom, and each new one goes on top
